# Chill❄️
## Introduction
Have you ever had that moment where you try to remember a song but just can't? Yeah me too. That's why I wanted to create a website where you can log the music that you love, while recommending that song to others who access this website. 

**Instructions**: You must log in to be able to add songs!

## Ice Box Items
- I want to use referencing to add a song so that users will be able to add that song into their profiles.
- I want to add a feature so that users can play the song on the website instead of going to a youtube link.
